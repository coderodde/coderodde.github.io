            <article>
                <h4 id="mcelp.1">1 Introduction</h4>
                <p>
                In the most cost-effective loan problem, we are given a directed
                graph of actors where each actor may lend some amount of resources
                it possesses to its child nodes. In case an actor needs more than
                his immediate parents can lend, the parents might need to lend from
                their parents, adjust the interest rate to cover their own expenses,
                and pass the funds to the original lending actor.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Formally, we are given a directed graph $G = (V, A)$, where $V$
                is the set of actors, and $A \subseteq V^2$ is the set of directed
                arcs. By $V(G)$ we denote the actor set of $G$, and likewise, by
                $A(G)$ we denote the arc set of $G$. Given an arc $(u, v) \in A$,
                we call $u$ a <i>parent</i> of $v$, $v$ a <i>child</i> of $u$. 
                Existence of such an arc indicates that $u$ may lend some or all
                of its resources to $v$. Along the graph, we are given a
                <i>potential function</i> $\mathfrak{P} \colon V \to [0, \infty) = \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$
                that maps each actor in the graph to the (non-negative) equity that that very
                node has at its disposal. Finally, we are given an <i>interest rate function</i>
                $\mathfrak{I} \colon A \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ that maps each arc
                $(u, v) \in A$ to the interest rate the actor $u$ can offer $v$
                when $v$ decides to lend from $u$. From now on, we will call the
                aforementioned amount of resources of equity simply <i>potential</i>.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Apart from the target data structure, in a problem instance, we
                are given an actor $a \in V$ that applies for a loan, a required
                potential $P \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ and a maximum tolerable 
                interest rate $i \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$. Our aim, then, is to 
                compute a loan (which may involve more than one lending actor) 
                with minimized interest rate.
                </p>
                
                <h4 id="mcelp.2">2 Interest rate model</h4>
                
                <p>
                Throughout the post, we assume a simple interest rate model. The
                accumulated balance at time $t$ since the time point at which the
                loan was issued, with initial principal $\mathfrak{A}$ and interest
                rate $r$ is given by
                \[
                \mathfrak{A}(1 + r)^t.
                \]
                If we have in the graph, for instance, a directed acyclic path 
                $\langle u, v, z \rangle$ with $r_{u,v}$ being the interest rate
                of $(u, v)$, and $r_{v, z}$ being the interest rate of $(v, z)$,
                the interest rate equation becomes
                \[
                \mathfrak{A}(1 + r_{u,v})^t (1 + r_{v,z})^t = \mathfrak{A}\big[ (1 + r_{u,v})(1 + r_{v,z}) \big]^t = \mathfrak{A}(1 + R)^t.
                \]
                Above, $R$ is the <i>combined</i> interest rate. Dividing both 
                sides by $\mathfrak{A}$ and taking $t$-th root, we obtain
                \begin{aligned}
                    (1 + r_{u,v})(1 + r_{v,z}) &= 1 + R \\
                    R + 1 &= 1 + r_{u,v} + r_{v,z} + r_{u,v}r_{v,z} \\
                    R &= r_{u,v} + r_{v,z} + r_{u,v}r_{v,z}. 
                \end{aligned}
                In general, we write $r_1 + r_2 + r_1 r_2 = \mathfrak{C}(r_1, r_2).$
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Since we may deal with entire &quot;loan chains&quot;, we need 
                to define the concept of <i>effective interest rate</i>.
                Effective interest rate is given by 
                \[
                    I(u, v) = 
                    \begin{cases}
                    \mathfrak{I}(u, v) &\mbox{if } (u, v) \in A \\
                    \underset{z \in {\rm C{\small HILDREN}}(G, u)}{\min} \, \mathfrak{C}\big(\mathfrak{I}(u, z), I(z, v)\big) &\mbox{otherwise,}
                    \end{cases}
                \]
                where ${\rm C{\small HILDREN}}(G, z)$ is the set of child nodes
                of $z$, or, formally, $\{ u \colon (z, u) \in A(G) \}.$
                </p>
                
                <h4 id="mcelp.3">3 Problem statement</h4>
                <p>
                Given a problem instance $(G, a, \mathfrak{P}, \mathfrak{I}, P, i)$,
                we wish to compute two additional functions: $\pi$ and $d$.
                $\pi \colon V \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ is called a 
                <i>solution potential function</i> and it maps each actor 
                $u$ to potential $\pi(u)$ $u$ can lend, and $d \colon V \to V$
                is called a <i>direction function</i> and it maps each actor
                $u$ to some of its children $d(u)$ to which $\pi(u)$ worth 
                potential is being lent. What comes to constraints, no actor
                $u$ lending some of its potential shall have $I(u, a) > i$,
                since $a$ cannot afford effective interest rates above $i$.
                Also, if it is not possible, due to the first constraint, to
                obtain a loan worth $P$, the loan should be maximized from below
                as close to $P$ as possible.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                In order to implement the first constraint, we need to define the
                set of <i>admissible</i> solution potential functions:
                \[
                \pi_{I, a, i, G} = \{ \pi \colon V(G) \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} \; | \; \pi(u) = 0 \text{ if } I(u, a) > i \}.
                \]
                An admissible solution potential function $\pi$ is said to be <i>valid</i>
                if it also satisfies
                \[
                    \sum_{u \in V} \pi(u) \in [0, P],
                \]
                and we denote that by $\pi \in \mathfrak{V}$.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Now, we can state the objective formally:
                \[
                \pi = \underset{\pi' \in \mathfrak{V}}{\arg \min}{\Bigg[ P - \sum_{u \in V} \pi'(u) \Bigg]},
                \]
                and
                \[
                d(u) = \underset{z \in {\rm C {\small HILDREN}}(G, u)}{\arg \min}\mathfrak{C}\big(\mathfrak{I}(u, z), I(z, a)\big).
                \]
                </p>
                
                <h4 id="mcelp.4">4 Solution algorithm</h4>
                <p>
                Since the effective interest rate does not decrease with adding
                more directed arcs, we must have that for any actor $a \in V$ the
                most cost-efficient lenders are its immediate parents. This observation
                implies that we basically wish to compute a directed &quot;minimum spanning tree&quot;
                in which each other node (except $a$) has a unique directed path to $a$.
                In the very beginning, the tree is trivial and consists only of $a$.
                Then a most cost-effective parent $u_1$ is selected and the arc $(u_1, a)$
                is introduced to the tree. Then $u_2$ is selected. It must not
                belong to $\{a, u_1\}$ while have the lowest possible effective rate
                among all nodes in $V \setminus \{ a, u_1 \}$. This procedure continues
                until a desired potential $P$ is collected or until there is no more nodes 
                left with affordable effective interest rates. Below 
                <span style="font-variant: small-caps; font-weight: bolder;">Priority-Queue-Insert</span>$(Q, \langle a, b, c \rangle)$
                stores the triple $\langle a, b, c \rangle$ in priority queue $Q$ and uses $c$ as the priority key.

                What comes to time complexity of the algorithm, it is sufficient 
                to observe that all the operations can be implemented to run in
                $\Theta(1)$ time. In particular, this applies to operating on $\pi, d, C$:
                we can use hash-table based sets and maps which run the basic operations
                in average constant time.</p>

                The effective interest rate function $I$ implicitly defines a transitive closure
                from any actor $u \neq a$ to $a$ assuming the effective interest rate of $u$ is
                within the constraint $I(u, a) \leq i$. That way, $a$ loans from all affordable
                parents (immediate or intermediate) in a greedy fashion: lend as much as possible
                from the most affordable actor, then lend as much as possible from the second most
                affordable actor, and so on until the requested potential is collected or there are
                no more affordable lenders left. It is easy to see that such strategy minimizes
                interest expenses.

                Without loss of generality, suppose the search enters the cycle via $u_1$. When $u_k$ will be
                removed from the priority queue, the arc $(u_k, u_1)$ will be ignored by the line 20 since $u_1$ is in $C$, and
                so there is no way $d(u_k)$ could be mapped to $u_1$.

                This is trivially guaranteed by the line 14 and the second test at line 12.

                We used a very simple interest rate model in our solution, and
                so it leaves the case where the used interest rate model is more
                realistic. In general, with initial principal $\mathfrak{A}$,
                interest rate $r > 0$, the number of compound periods $n$ per time unit, and time 
                since the moment the loan was issued $t$, the balance grows 
                according to 
                \[
                    \mathfrak{C} = \mathfrak{A}\Bigg( 1 + \frac{r}{n} \Bigg)^{\lfloor nt \rfloor}.
                \]
                Also, as $n \to \infty$, $\mathfrak{C} \to \mathfrak{A}e^{rt}$.
                Combining loans with different parameters in a meaningful way 
                seems to be a non-trivial task but we might address it later.

        <h1>1 Introduction</h1>
        <h2>1.1 What this page is about?</h2>
        <p>
            This page will describe the sieve task you need to complete in order to qualify as a front end developer at Insured Oy for the <code>vakuutustiedot.fi</code> web service.
        </p>

        <h2>1.2 General description of the task</h2>
        <p>
            Informally, you need to create a web page that communicates with the backend via a WebSocket. 
            The idea is that all the users visiting your page can modify a shared list of devices. Each user can:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>add a new device to the shared list of devices,</li>
            <li>edit the details of an existing device,</li>
            <li>remove a device from the shared list.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Most important requirement is that when any user works on the list, the remaining users see the changes <b><i>immediately</i></b>.
        </p>
        
        <h2>1.3 Device description</h2>
        <p>Each device is described by four fields:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>device ID,</li>
            <li>device name,</li>
            <li>device description,</li>
            <li>device status (on/off).</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>All fields except the device ID are visible to the users.</p>
		
        <h1>2 The backend specification</h1>
        
        <p>The WebSocket endpoint is deployed at 
            <code>wss://device-endpoint.herokuapp.com/devices</code>. The communication with the endpoint is done via JSON-formatted messages.
        </p> 
        
        <h2>2.1 Operation specifications</h2>
        
        <!--////////////////////////////-->
        <h4>2.1.1 Adding a new device</h4>
        <h5>2.1.1.1 Description</h5>
        <p>Adds a new device to the shared list. The tuple consisting of name, description and toggle status of the new device is not required to be unique over the entire device list.</p>
        
        <h5>2.1.1.2 Synopsis</h5>
		<p>In order to add a new device, send to the endpoint a JSON-formatted text message in the following format:</p>
        <blockquote>
				<pre><code>{"action":"create",
 "deviceName":"Your device name",
 "deviceDescription":"Your device description",
 "deviceStatus":true}</code></pre>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Above, <code>"action":"create"</code> tells the endpoint that we are adding a 
            new device, the values of the keys <code>"deviceName"</code> and 
            <code>"deviceDescription"</code> are the device name and description, 
            respectively. Whether to allow empty strings for the aforementioned values, 
            is up to you and doesn't affect your score. Finally, the value of <code>"deviceStatus"</code> is a boolean value <code>true/false</code> corresponding to whether the device is toggled on or off.</p>
        
        <h5>2.1.1.3 Endpoint response</h5>
        After sending the above message to the endpoint, the endpoint will send the following message to <b>all</b> the connected clients:
        <blockquote><pre><code>{"succeeded":true,
 "message":"A device \"Your device name\" is successfully added.",
 "action":"create",
 "deviceId":10,
 "deviceName":"Your device name",
 "deviceDescription":"Your device description",
 "deviceStatus":true}</code></pre></blockquote>
        <!--Since endpoint will never fail to create a device, the value of <code>"succeeded"</code> will always be <code>true</code>.
        The value of <code>"deviceId"</code> will, however, vary.
        
        <h5>2.1.1.4 Additional requirements</h5>
        <p>When any user adds a new device, the device in question appears in the view of any other user.</p>-->
        
        
        
        
        <!--///////////////////////////////////-->
        <h4>2.1.2 Editing an existing device</h4>
        <h5>2.1.2.1 Description</h5>
        <p>When a user edits any information field of a device (device name, device description or device status), all the other users can see the change.</p>
        
        <h5>2.1.2.2 Synopsis</h5>
        <blockquote>
			<pre><code>{"action":"update",
 "deviceId":10,
 "deviceName":"Your device name",
 "deviceDescription":"Your device description2",
 "deviceStatus":true}</code></pre>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Above, <code>"action":"update"</code> tells the endpoint that we are 
            updating the information of an existing device with ID 10. Beyond ID 
            and action, the three other fields just specify the new values.</p>
        
        <h5>2.1.2.3 Endpoint response</h5>
        <!--Upon success (the device with a specified ID is on the shared list), the endpoint will respond with-->
		After sending the above message to the endpoint, the endpoint will send the following message to all the connected clients:
        <blockquote>
			<pre><code>{"succeeded":true,
 "message":"Information of the device \"Your device name\" is successfully updated.",
 "action":"update",
 "deviceId":10,
 "deviceName":"Your device name",
 "deviceDescription":"Your device description2",
 "deviceStatus":true}</code></pre>
        </blockquote>
		<!--
        In case there is no device with a given ID, the endpoint will respond with
        <blockquote>
			<pre>
				<code>
{"succeeded":false,
 "message":"There is no device with ID 11.",
 "action":"update",
 "deviceId":11}
				</code>
			</pre>
        </blockquote>
        
        <h5>2.1.2.4 Additional requirements</h5>
        <p>Whenever a user inserts/removes a single character from a device's name or description, or toggles the device status, the changes are immediately propagated
        to any other user's view.</p>-->
        
        
        
        
        <!--//////////////////////////////////-->
        <h4>2.1.3 Removing an existing device</h4>
        <h5>2.1.3.1 Description</h5>
        <p>Within a view of each device, there should be a button that, once being pressed, removes the device from the shared list.</p>
        
        <h5>2.1.3.2 Synopsis</h5>
        <blockquote>
            <pre><code>{"action":"remove",
 "deviceId":10}</code></pre>
        </blockquote>
        
        <h5>2.1.3.3 Endpoint response</h5>
		After sending the above message to the endpoint, the endpoint will send the following message to all the connected clients:
        <blockquote>
			<pre><code>{"succeeded":true,
 "message":"Device \"Your device name\" is successfully removed.",
 "action":"remove",
 "deviceId":10}</code></pre>
        </blockquote>
        
		<!--
        In the case there is no device with a given ID, the endpoint will respond with 
        <blockquote>
			<pre>
				<code>
{"succeeded":false,
 "message":"No device with ID 11.",
 "action":"remove",
 "deviceId":11}
				</code>
			</pre>
        </blockquote>
        
        <h5>2.1.3.4 Additional requirements</h5>
        <p>Whenever a user successfully removes a device, the device disappears from the list of all other users.</p>-->
        
        
        <!--/////////////////////////////-->
		<h1>3 Other specifications</h1>
        <h2>3.1 Opening the page</h2>
        <p>When a new user appears by opening the page, the frontend code must load the entire device list. (Hint: You don't actually need any explicit code to implement this.)</p>
		
		<h2>3.2 Message text</h2>
		<p>In addition, you should create a text container that shows all the messages the endpoint responds with.</p>
        
		<!--/////////////////////////////-->
		<h1>4 Submission instructions</h1>
